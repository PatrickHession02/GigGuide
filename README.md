GigGuide is an innovative Final Year Project that integrates Spotify, ChatGPT, Ticketmaster API and Google Places API to provide users with personalized notifications and comprehensive information about concerts in their area. Developed as an Expo application, GigGuide offers a seamless experience for users to stay updated on upcoming events and discover new music experiences using AI recommendations.
By harnessing the power of these APIs, GigGuide aims to enhance the concert-going experience by delivering timely and relevant information tailored to each user's preferences and location.
